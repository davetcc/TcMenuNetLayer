# TcMenu LwIP and driver network library. For EXPERIMENTAL use only

**EXPERIMENTAL and not intended to be used outside of development at the moment.** 
 
## Summary

Dave Cherry / TheCodersCorner.com make this framework available for you to use. It takes me significant effort to keep all my libraries current and working on a wide range of boards. Please consider making at least a one off donation via the sponsor button if you find it useful.

TcMenu LwIP Network library is part of the tcMenu solution for the Arduino and mbed platform, see the main library https://github.com/davetcc/tcMenu for more information.

In any fork, please ensure all text up to here is left unaltered.

This library provides LwIP specific functionality on supported hardware. **It is in a BETA state on ESP32 and DEVELOPER state on STM32.**


## Presently this library supports

* Most ESP32 devices using Wi-Fi. Status: BETA
* Some STM32 based boards that have built in Ethernet. Status: DEVELOPER PREVIEW

## Notes

This is a low level driver for tcMenu, and is only really useful in that context.

## Contributing

We only have the capacity to support the boards we immediately use, if you want to support another library, please open an issue to discuss.
